    "It is said that you can measure the intelligence of an AI from the amount it can compress a text without information loss.\n",
    "One way to think about this is that, the more a text is predictable, the more words we can leave out of it as we can guess the missing words.\n",
    "On the other hand, the more intelligent an AI is, the more it will find texts to be predictable and so the more words it can leave out and guess.\n",
    "This has led to a competition called the [Hutter Prize](http://prize.hutter1.net/) where the objective is to compress a given text as much as possible.\n",
    "The record for compressing a 1GB text file extracted from a Wikipedia snapshot is about 115MB.\n",
    "The main hurdle here is that the program used to decompress the file must be treated as part of the compressed file, meaning that the program itself must also be small.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we're going to be doing something similar using a smaller text file and using neural language models to guess missing words."
